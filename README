termovie is for terminal movies, simple one-time or repeating animations on the
command line. The resource is in following format:

<separator line>
<frame>
<separator line>
...
<frame>
<separator line>

The frames can vary in contents, width, and height, but the separator must be
_exactly_ the same each time. It is not specified by the format, and can be
anything as long as there is consistency.

Example: a loading spinner

termovie -l << MOVIE &
-
/

-
 \

-

 /
-

\
-
MOVIE
# Do some work
kill $!

This will display a loading animation until you tell it that you are done.
